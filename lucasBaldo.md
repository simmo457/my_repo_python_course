Hello! 
I'm Lucas, a PhD student at the department of Physics and Astronomy at UU, under supervision of Prof. Annica Black-Schaffer.
I study unconventional superconductivity, mainly through numerical calculations.
Unconventional superconductors are materials which, despite showing features of superconductivity (such as zero resistivity and the Meissner effect), are not described by the BCS theory. Understanding these materials could lead one day to the engineering of room-temperature superconductors and topological qubits for quantum computation.
